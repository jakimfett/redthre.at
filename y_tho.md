**Hey Andrew.**  
How many hours did you prepare your hair, face, and that annoyingly spiffy suit of yours before coming into court, as a witness proclaiming lies about me, under oath, before a judge?  
How long did it take for you to be flustered and being told to stay quiet by aforementioned judge, and by your employees?  

That's a really bad time/frustration ratio for someone who stands to lose everything if they handle this incorrectly.  
Tisk.  
I taught you better than that.

Also, context matters.



## MAJOR GRIEVANCE(S)
I literally said, in a Founding Four meeting, that:  
`I trust youto take care of the management and HR and payroll stuff if that allows me to focus on my tech stuff`.  
This was cheered on, and yet literally every single responsibility I offloaded was botched, mishandled, or ignored within a week.

> As far as trust goes:  
> I still planned, and prepared, as if each of them was *literally [the devil](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Needful)*, because that's my power level.  

Pulling a thinly veiled hostile takeover attempt, couched as "embezzlement", is actually kinda cute.  
I planned for like...Lex Luthor.  
I'm underwhelmed by your redux of The Hamburgler, Andrew.

It does make my job a ton easier.  
_Thanks for that bee tee dubhs._

I advocated for healthcare and bonuses for you.  
I was a money liability to them, of course they want me gone in the short term.  
I had long term vision though, and when you're in business, you have to start with 30 year goals.  

Andrew had authorized and encouraged me to build something for a convention (specifically, Black Hat and/or Defcon) while I was off on medical leave.

> We went to a lot of the same classes, Andrew.  
> How did you miss so much from [Leavitt's](https://inside.corban.edu/personnel/donald-r-leavitt) lectures?

I made Lyft and alcohol petty cash type purchases, when   
At worst, that's a strongly worded email about keeping "miscelaneous research costs" low, (...maybe followed up by a visit in person to see if I'm doing okay?), not...whatever "this" is, where we are today.  

Because, I'd like it noted for the record, that I got authorization from Andrew, personally, to use the company card for assorted expenses in spring 2017, in the context of me being the CTO of a successful company with two local locations and a shot at more throughout the Pacific Northwest.  

Not once.  
Twice.  
**I asked for permission to use company money _twice_,**  
**and both times Andrew said "yes".**

> I think, when I'm being uncharitable, that a couple hundred bucks per week on transportation and alcohol, especially with how much Vincent likes getting people MinoTaurs at The River Pig (and, yaknow, all the business meetings at fancy sports bars, Andrew), the cost fell through the cracks for long enough that when he (Andrew) looked at the quarterly amount on the card, it was larger than he expected, and having been presented with an opportunity to quasi-legally shoehorn me out of the company, he (Andrew) jumped at it..

Or something.  
I've yet to even see an itemized amounts list of the so-called 'embezzled amounts'.  
They threatened (or, at least, their lawyer did on a recorded line) to send armed individuals to my house and assault me and violate my basic human rights as well as due process of law.  

And *these* are the people you trust with your social security numbers and your home addresses?  

...yikes.

## minour grievances
See how close the first word of that heading is to `minotaur`...?  
> yeah, that's definitely intentional

### Blitzkrieg Gate Lock
Vincent.  
Your one redeeming quality is that you, once upon a time, kept Andrew from breaking my face.  

Do you have any idea how wrong it is that I had to fight, against both you and Andrew, for the right to *not be yelled at when someone else didn't read my very clearly labeled parts before welding it, permanently, into a metal frame*?

Yeah.  
I've been mulling on that one for a bit.  

Maybe if you thought about that sort of stuff too, your "luck with the ladies" wouldn't be so abysmal.


### Cosmos Central Pillar Plate
...I asked for a *very specific size*, Vincent.  

Do you even know what those words, in that specific combination, mean?  

Your incompetence at understanding and acting on specific instructions for materials, combined with Andrew's constant refusal to allow sufficient time to polish a room before going "live", meant that the business was always in "triage problem" mode, and despite the dozen or so times each year I did a full reset and organization of the workspace, frontend always took priority.  

> **Cosmos was an amazing design.**  
> You lost Sessha's active input because of how poorly you handled the management of this room.

> The tech was dicy, at launch, because major chunks of the tech had to be rebuilt completely from scratch, and you never gave me the time to focus my full attention on fixing the problems with the room thanks to constantly pushing me out of the space to run the (very broken) room, which OF COURSE OUR CUSTOMERS RATED POORLY.

This constant focus on the frontend at the detriment of the back resulted in constant piles of messes, because stuff was always "too messy to clean properly", or other such idiotic nonsense, and piles of garbage were literally dumped on my workspaces, constantly.

> I even had to set up automatic purchasing of toilet paper for you [idjits](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/index.php?title=Idjit), and I *really* hope that broke when you canceled my Amazon account access.

> May you be constantly faced, professionally, with a post-defecation choice between a cardboard tube and last week's napkin (to wipe with).  
> May you face constant, low level anxiety that, should you stop to defecate while hiking, it will attract the attention of the horny gay bears.

Constant excuses about why my very exact requirements constantly couldn't be met, meant that _anything important had to be done, purchased, or obtained by me, directly._  

Over the course of years, that led to burnout, and the idiocy with the claims of embezzlement are the icing on this incompetence cake.

### punisher
It really annoyed me that, as an identifying photograph of me, to the court where you argued that I was a dangerous individual, you found the one picture, the *one* picture, where I was wearing the slightest visually aggressive thing (wearing a "Punisher" beanie) in a photograph, which by the way I took that picture as a joke, because I swapped hats on Doug (my then-roommate) to see if he would notice.

He never did.
But then, we pulled a lot of fun pranks with the contents of our Loot Crate boxes.  
I doubt he remembers the fun we had.  
But we did both got the hats.  

Doug showed up in a suit and tie to falsely accuse his former roommate and punster, with a picture of the punisher.

> it breaks my heart a little bit.  
> I really, genuinely thought we were friends at one point in time.  
>  
> Oh well.  
> I'll find a different Morty.

The kicker is, it was also a picture I'm pretty sure I originally sent to _Doug's sister_, who was listed as one of the people "worried about my presence in the area". I'd like it noted for the record that I've been on the path of the pacifist since before she met me, and that I'm very sorry if I've ever caused her any concern about or distress over her safety.

I'm half baked in the picture, too, which means I was super un-aggressive IRL at the time.  

But I digress.
